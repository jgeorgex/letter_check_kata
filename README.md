The customer wants to check how many times the letter `a` appears in a string, and the total number of characters in the string. The method will only ever receive strings containing letters. The following outputs are expected:

letter_count("a") => "1/1"
letter_count("abcd") => "1/4"
letter_count("xyz") => "0/3"
letter_count("abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd") => "6/24"
